# Lanyard Assets

This folder should contain two files:

1. **card.glb** - The 3D model file for the card
2. **lanyard.png** - The texture file for the lanyard band

## How to get these files:

1. Visit the ReactBits GitHub repository: https://github.com/DavidHDev/react-bits
2. Navigate to the Lanyard component directory
3. Look for the `src/assets/lanyard` folder
4. Download both `card.glb` and `lanyard.png` files
5. Place them in this directory: `components/assets/lanyard/`

## Alternative: Using the ReactBits CLI

You can also use the shadcn CLI to install the component with assets:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @react-bits/Lanyard-JS-CSS
```

This will automatically download the required assets.

## Customizing the card

You can edit the `card.glb` file using an online editor:

The `lanyard.png` file can be edited in any image editor to change the texture of the lanyard band.
